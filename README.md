Just a playground for experimenting with some random ideas:

* [Countable](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Countable.hs):
  countable types whose values can be aggregated in a fixed sequence.
* [Lem](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Lem.hs):
  an encoding of the law of excluded middle.
* [SelectiveZero](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/SelectiveZero.hs):
  extending the `Selective` type class with `zero`.
