[![Build status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/snowleopard/ideas/ci.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/actions)

Just a playground for experimenting with some random ideas:

* [Async](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Async.hs):
  A basic concurrency monad with links to asynchronous circuits.

* [Components](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Components.hs):
  A family of Concurrent Connected Components algorithms.

* [Countable](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Countable.hs):
  Countable types whose values can be aggregated in a fixed sequence.

* [Early](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Early.hs):
  Composable monads and early `return` for `do`-expressions.

* [GraphSearch](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/GraphSearch.hs):
  Experimenting with generic DFS and BFS graph search algorithms.

* [Lem](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Lem.hs):
  An encoding of the law of excluded middle.

* [Metamorphisms](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Metamorphisms.hs):
  Playing with metamorphisms.

* [Moore](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Moore.hs):
  Playing with Moore machines.

* [Nested](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Nested.hs):
  Nested functors, i.e., computations of the shape `f (f a)`.

* [SelectiveZero](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/SelectiveZero.hs):
  Extending the `Selective` type class with `zero`.
