Just a playground for experimenting with some random ideas:

* [Countable](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/countable/Countable.hs),
  countable types whose values can be aggregated in a fixed sequence
* [Lem](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/lem/Lem.hs),
  an encoding of the law of excluded middle
