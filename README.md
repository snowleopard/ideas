Just a playground for experimenting with some random ideas:

* [Aggregate](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/aggregate/Aggregate.hs),
  a generalisation of existential and universal quantifiers
* [Lem](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/lem/Lem.hs),
  an encoding of the law of excluded middle
