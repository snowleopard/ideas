[![Build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/snowleopard/ideas/ci/main.svg)](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/actions)

Just a playground for experimenting with some random ideas:

* [Async](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Async.hs):
  a basic concurrency monad with links to asynchronous circuits.

* [Components](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Components.hs):
  a family of Concurrent Connected Components algorithms.

* [Countable](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Countable.hs):
  countable types whose values can be aggregated in a fixed sequence.

* [Early](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Early.hs):
  composable monads and early `return` for `do`-expressions.

* [GraphSearch](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/GraphSearch.hs):
  experimenting with generic DFS and BFS graph search algorithms.

* [Lem](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Lem.hs):
  an encoding of the law of excluded middle.

* [Metamorphisms](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Metamorphisms.hs):
  playing with metamorphisms.

* [Nested](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/Nested.hs):
  nested functors, i.e., computations of the shape `f (f a)`.

* [SelectiveZero](https://github.com/snowleopard/ideas/blob/main/src/SelectiveZero.hs):
  extending the `Selective` type class with `zero`.
